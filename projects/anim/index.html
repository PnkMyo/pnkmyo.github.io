		<p>Welcome to my animation projects page ! Here, you will find my animation projects. Exciting !</p>

<h1 id="ynm"><img src="img/ynm.jpg" /></h1>
<p>Yield No More is about Eve, a girl who begins to experience strange things one day, and enters a coma. The show follows  her in her dreams, as she tries to wake up. Nightmares and weirdness ensues. The show is essentially my own dream journal, although I am making some changes here and there to the dreams from their source materal. Some of the dreams are written not from real dreams, too. The series' pilot was my first ever animation project, so don't expect anything too big. I've gotten much, MUCH better at the entire process since then.<br /> <br /><br /></p>
