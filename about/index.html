		<h1>ABOUT</h1>
		<p class="centerf"> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- </p>
		<p>Hiya ! My name is Elizabeth Sunner, and I make things... Lots of things. You may know me from my music, which, I've already mentioned on the front page what music projects I have, but did you know I do other things too ?</p>

	<h1 id="musictag">MUSIC</h1>

	<p> So, way back in Ye Olde 2013, I made my first &quotserious&quot song. Sort of. It was the first song I ever made with the software I use these days. Back then, I used the free version of MuLab 4. It was... Definitely an early version, I'll just say that much. But as time went on, I got more experienced with my music. I experimented more, seeing what sounds good, I fine-tuned my workflow, etc. And now I'm here. Exciting ! <sup><sub>NOTE: After using MuLab 8 for many years, I have switched over to Renoise. Friendship ended with MuLab, Renoise is now my best friend.</sub></sup>
<br /> <br />  <br />
I make many genres. A few examples of what I make include;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Dance/House</li>
	<li>Ambient</li>
	<li>Drum n' Bass/Breakcore/Jungle/Liquid Drum n' Bass</li>
	<li>Rock (of all sorts !)</li>
	<li>Noise</li>
	<li>Screamo rap drum and bass clusterfuck ? (haven't released anything yet, but i <i>have</i> done this before)</li>
	<li>Soundtracks</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of my sound design is original. Most of it. I do love collecting sample CDs &lt:
<br />I'm told my sound design methods are, &quotunorthodox&quot. It might be because I actually take recordings of, let's say, my guitar, and I mess with it. Stretching, pitch shifting, graining, putting some reverb or chorus or live pitch shifting on it, distorting it, looping it, you name it. It's super fun ! Although, these days, I sometimes use synths as the basis for this SAMPLE WITCH MAGIC :D
<br /> <br />  <br />
But on that sample CD thing. I love to buy samples, because, hell, I absolutely cannot make drums from scratch for the life of me... Unless I'm using my TRUSTY metal chair piece. The one I don't have anymore. ...Huh... But yeah, I collect sample CDs. I pretty much only use things I can't make on my own, though, like pianos and drums and stuff. Sometimes, I even like to use the <img src="img/flutter2.png"align="center" /> !
<br /> <br />  <br />
Over time, I SOMEHOW accumulated 300+ songs. I stopped counting a long time ago, I don't know how many I have now. But, my output on music has slowed down significantly, due to taking care of myself more, and having more projects to work on than just music. And that brings me to...</p>

	<h1>ART and ANIMATION</h1>
<p color="white">Art ! Animation ! Wow ! So, around the same year I started music (2013), I decided, "hey, I love animation. I should learn it..."
<br /> And so I did ! I started learning it, studying it, watching videos and stuff. <sup><sub>NOTE: I never took any classes on animation, it's all self-taught.</sub></sup> And for the next few years, I would continue to do that. Sometime in 2016, I stopped studying it, though. I thought I was never going to put my knowledge to good use. Boy, was that dumb, seeing as I'm finally putting it to &quotgood use&quot... 
<br /> <br />  <br />
The Yield No More EPISODE 0: PILOT was released sometime in the middle of 2018. I can't really check right now, I'm making this website while I'm offline. If you're reading this, chances are, I forgot to replace this text. It was my first ever animation project, and it was something I was wanting to do ever since I started studying animation. Yield No More is a series based off of my dreams... It's essentially a dream diary, only Silent Hill-ish and not something to watch at night. You can read more about it here; </p>

<p>And as for my art, I don't have much to say about it. Normally when I do cartoonish stuff, it's cutesy/goth. When I do paintings, it's horror. But yeah... I don't have much else to talk about here. <br /> <br /> <br /> </p>
